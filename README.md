# Amazon Kinesis Client Library for Ruby

This package provides an interface to the Amazon Kinesis Client Library's (KCL) [MultiLangDaemon][multi-lang-daemon]
for the Ruby language.
Developers can use the [Amazon KCL][amazon-kcl] to build distributed applications that process streaming data reliably
at scale. The [Amazon KCL][amazon-kcl] takes care of many of the complex tasks associated with distributed computing,
such as load-balancing across multiple instances, responding to instance failures, checkpointing processed records,
and reacting to changes in stream volume.
This package wraps and manages the interaction with the [MultiLangDaemon][multi-lang-daemon] which is part of the
[Amazon KCL for Java][amazon-kcl-github] so that developers can focus on implementing their record processor
executable. A record processor in Ruby typically looks something like:

```ruby
    #! /usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'aws/kclrb'

    class SampleRecordProcessor < Aws::KCLrb::V2::RecordProcessorBase
      def init_processor(initialize_input)
        # initialize
      end

      def process_records(process_records_input)
        # process batch of records
      end

      def lease_lost(lease_lost_input)
        # lease was lost, cleanup
      end

      def shard_ended(shard_ended_input)
        # shard has ended, cleanup
      end

      def shutdown_requested(shutdown_requested_input)
        # shutdown has been requested
      end
    end

    if __FILE__ == $0
      # Start the main processing loop
      record_processor = SampleRecordProcessor.new
      driver = Aws::KCLrb::KCLProcess.new(record_processor)
      driver.run
    end
```

## Before You Get Started

Before running the samples, you'll want to make sure that your environment is
configured to allow the samples to use your
[AWS Security Credentials](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html).

By default the samples use the [DefaultCredentialsProvider][DefaultCredentialsProvider]
so you'll want to make your credentials available to one of the credentials providers in that
provider chain. There are several ways to do this such as providing a `~/.aws/credentials` file,
or if you're running on Amazon EC2, you can associate an IAM role with your instance with appropriate
access.

For questions regarding [Amazon Kinesis Service][amazon-kinesis] and the client libraries please check the
[official documentation][amazon-kinesis-docs] as well as the [Amazon Kinesis Forums][kinesis-forum].

## ðŸš¨Important: Migration to Ruby KCL 2.2.0 or later with MultiLangDaemon - Credential Provider Changes Required
Java KCL version 2.7.0 and later uses AWS SDK for Java 2.x instead of AWS SDK for Java 1.x. For the KCL Ruby 2.x versions,
v2.2.0 is the first Ruby release to use Java KCL 2.7.0. All MultiLangDaemon users upgrading from earlier versions must update
their credential provider configuration in the `.properties` file to use credentials provider name for AWS SDK for Java 2.x.
Failure to do this will cause your multilang KCL application to fail during startup with credential provider construction errors.
Please check the following link for the credentials provider mapping and MultiLangDaemon credentials provider configuration guide

- [AWS SDK for Java 1.x to 2.x Credentials Provider Mapping](aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/migration-client-credentials.html#credentials-changes-mapping)
- [KCL Multilang Credentials Provider Configuration Guide](https://github.com/aws/amazon-kinesis-client/blob/master/docs/multilang/configuring-credential-providers.md)

## Running the Sample

Using the Amazon KCL for Ruby package requires the [MultiLangDaemon][multi-lang-daemon] which
is provided by the [Amazon KCL for Java][amazon-kcl-github]. Rake tasks are provided to start the sample
application(s) and download all the required dependencies.

The sample application consists of two components:

* A data producer (`samples/sample_kcl_producer.rb`): this script creates an Amazon Kinesis
  stream and starts putting random records into it.
* A data processor (`samples/sample_kcl.rb`): this script is invoked by the
  [MultiLangDaemon][multi-lang-daemon] and consumes the data from the Amazon Kinesis
  stream and stores it into files (1 file per shard).

The following defaults are used in the sample application:

* *Stream name*: `kclrbsample`
* *Region*: `us-east-1`
* *Number of shards*: 2
* *Amazon KCL application name*: `RubyKCLSample`
* *Amazon DynamoDB table for KCL application*: `RubyKCLSample`
* *Amazon CloudWatch metrics namespace for KCL application*: `RubyKCLSample`

### Running the Data Producer

To run the data producer, run the following commands:

```sh
    cd samples
    rake run_producer
```

#### Notes

* The [AWS Ruby SDK gem][aws-ruby-sdk-gem] needs to be installed as a pre-requisite. To install,
  run:

  ```sh
      sudo gem install aws-sdk
  ```

* The script `samples/sample_kcl_producer.rb` takes several parameters that you can use
  to customize its behavior. To see the available options, run:

  ```sh
      samples/sample_kcl_producer.rb --help
  ```

### Running the Data Processor

To run the data processor, run the following commands:

```sh
    cd samples
    rake run properties_file=sample.properties
```

#### Notes

* The `JAVA_HOME` environment variable needs to point to a valid JVM.
* The rake task invokes the [MultiLangDaemon][multi-lang-daemon] passing to it the
  properties file `samples/sample.properties`. This file contains the
  information needed to bootstrap the sample application, e.g.

  * `executableName = samples/sample_kcl.rb`
  * `streamName = kclrbsample`
  * `applicationName = RubyKCLSample`
  * `regionName = us-east-1`

### Cleaning Up

This sample application creates a real Amazon Kinesis stream and sends real data to it, and
create a real DynamoDB table to track the Amazon KCL application state, thus potentially
incurring AWS costs. Once done, you can log in to AWS management console and delete these
resources. Specifically, the sample application will create in your default AWS region

* an *Amazon Kinesis Data Stream* named `kclrbsample`
* an *Amazon DynamoDB table* named `RubyKCLSample`

## Running on Amazon EC2

Running on Amazon EC2 is simple. Assuming you are already logged into an Amazon EC2
instance running Amazon Linux, the following steps will prepare your environment
for running the sample application. Note the version of Java that ships with
Amazon Linux can be found at `/usr/bin/java` and should be 1.7 or greater.

```sh
    # install some prerequisites if missing
    sudo yum install gcc patch git ruby rake rubygems ruby-devel
    # install the AWS Ruby SDK (pre-requisuite for producer)
    sudo gem install aws-sdk aws-kclrb
    # clone the git repository to work with the samples
    git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-client-ruby.git kclrb
    # run the sample
    cd kclrb/samples
    rake run_producer
    # ... and in another terminal
    rake run properties_file=sample.properties
```

## Under the Hood - What You Should Know about Amazon KCL's [MultiLangDaemon][multi-lang-daemon]

Amazon KCL for Ruby uses [Amazon KCL for Java][amazon-kcl-github] internally. We have implemented
a Java-based daemon, called the *MultiLangDaemon* that does all the heavy lifting. Our approach
has the daemon spawn the user-defined record processor script/program as a sub-process. The
*MultiLangDaemon* communicates with this sub-process over standard input/output using a simple
protocol, and therefore the record processor script/program can be written in any language.

At runtime, there will always be a one-to-one correspondence between a record processor, a child process,
and an [Amazon Kinesis Shard][amazon-kinesis-shard]. The *MultiLangDaemon* will make sure of
that, without any need for the developer to intervene.

In this release, we have abstracted these implementation details away and exposed an interface that enables
you to focus on writing record processing logic in Ruby. This approach enables [Amazon KCL][amazon-kcl] to
be language agnostic, while providing identical features and similar parallel processing model across
all languages.
